#TouchUp AI - Advanced Image Editing Model
TouchUp AI Logo

TouchUp AI is a powerful Python-based machine learning project designed to revolutionize image editing. This sophisticated model takes textual input from the user and utilizes deep learning algorithms to perform advanced image editing, allowing users to effortlessly enhance and modify their images with precision.

##Features
**Intuitive Text-Based Input:** TouchUp AI enables users to provide textual instructions specifying desired edits to their images. Through natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model interprets the instructions to understand the user's editing requirements.

**Customizable Input Power:** Users have the flexibility to control the intensity of the applied edits using the input power parameter. This empowers users to fine-tune the editing process according to their artistic vision.

**Seamless Image Regeneration:** With TouchUp AI, the user's input is translated into a regenerated image that incorporates the specified edits. The model ensures accurate execution of editing tasks based on the user's instructions.

##Getting Started
###Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose your preferred backend)
- Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

###Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TouchUp-AI.git
cd TouchUp-AI
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###Usage
1. Prepare your input data: Create a text file containing the editing instructions for the image (e.g., adjust brightness, apply filters, etc.).

2. Run the TouchUp AI model, specifying the input data file and desired input power:
```bash
Copy code
python touchup_ai.py --input_data input.txt --input_power 0.8
```
3. The model will process the input and regenerate the edited image. Both the original and edited images will be saved to the output directory.
